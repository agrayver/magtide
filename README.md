# Magnetic signatures of ocean tidal signals

This repo provides some utilities to calculate and visualize magnetic fields due to different tidal constituents based on their spherical harmonic expansion coefficients. This is meant to support this publication (accepted manuscript can also be found in thisrepository)

The figures below show real and imaginary parts since the tidal signals are harmonic and usually analysed in frequency domain.
